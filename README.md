# StopGameProject
Final project game for ENGR 103 using CPX board.

## Game Description
Game uses the LED pixels in a rotary encoder fashion while we use the buttons to control/stop the light on the correct position. The board will play corresponding sounds depending on if the light is stopped on the correct spot, and either a green or red pixel will illuminate. Each level increases in speed of the light rotation. Once the final level is passed a song will play to congratulate you, and a light show will be displayed. The switch selects the home menu or starts the game. The light sensor will detect if it is very dark and turn off the sound at a certain threshold.
